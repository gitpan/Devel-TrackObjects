Devel::TrackObjects
===================

With this module you can track the usage of objects
and compare it with your expectations. 
Especially you can use it to find leaks where objects
don't get destroyed.

By redefining CORE::GLOBAL::bless it will catch the
creation of objects. Then it will make a weak reference
to the object which can later be used to decide, if the
object was destroyed or not.

To work you have to put Devel::Leak early in your
code, because it will not be able to redefine 'bless'
in already loaded modules.

It is in some way similar to Devel::Leak but:

 * can only handle objects
 * can restrict the tracking to specific classes
 * you don't need to have the perl compiled with
   -DDEBUGGING to get detailed information
